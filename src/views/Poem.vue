            Alone <br>

by Edgar Allan Poe<br>
(published 1875)<br>
<br>
<br>
From childhood's hour I have not been <br>
As others were <br> 
I have not seen As others saw <br> 
I could not bring <br>
My passions from a common spring <br>
From the same source <br>
I have not taken My sorrow <br> 
I could not awaken My heart<br>
to joy at the same tone <br>
And all I lov'd I lov'd alone <br>
Then in my childhood <br>
in the dawn Of a most<br>
stormy life was drawn <br>
From ev'ry depth of good and ill <br>
The mystery which binds me still <br>
From the torrent, or the fountain <br>
From the red cliff of the mountain <br>
From the sun that 'round me roll'd <br>
In its autumn tint of gold <br>
From the lightning in the sky <br>
As it pass'd me flying by <br>
From the thunder, and the storm <br>
And the cloud that took the form <br>
(When the rest of Heaven was blue) <br>
Of a demon in my view
